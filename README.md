# Vehicle Management System: Car Rentals and Sales

This repository contains the code and data for a data science project focused on predicting key metrics for a car rental and sale system. The objective of this system is to leverage data science models to forecast rental/sale pricing and vehicle popularity based on various factors.

## Objectives

The system provides the following predictive capabilities:

- Rental Price Prediction: Forecast rental prices based on seasonal trends and historical data.
- Vehicle Popularity Prediction: Predict the popularity of different rental car types.
- Model-Specific Price Prediction: Estimate rental prices for specific car models based on historical data.

## üß∞ Dev Setup

### üêç The Python setup

1. Install [Python 3.9](python.org) or higher on your computer.
2. Install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) on your computer.
3. Create a new conda environment:

    ```bash
    conda create -y -n=venv-vehicle-management-system python=3.10.8
    ```
4. Activate the environment and make sure you have `pip` installed inside that environment:

  ```console
  # the exact `activate` command will vary depending on your OS
  conda activate venv-vehicle-management-system 
  ```

üí° Remember to activate this particular `conda` environment whenever you reopen VSCode/the terminal.

10. Install required libraries

  ```console
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

Now, whenever you open a Jupyter Notebook, you should see the `venv-vehicle-management-system` kernel available. You can also run `jupyter kernelspec list` to see all the kernels available on your computer.
